# StemEd

## Description

StemEd is an app for education on STEM subjects. Complete with written lessons and exercises.

## Getting started

All data is stored in JSON format and should be stored in either a local instance of a NoSQL database or an online service, such as Mongo Atlas. A .env file should be made in the server folder following the 
sample.env example. Afterwards the user can install all node dependencies and the command npm run seed to populate their database with the available lessons. A user can then simply navigate to the webpage and interact with the lessons. A user should sign in in order to save their completed lessons.
